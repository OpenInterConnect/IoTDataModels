  description: |
    This resource describes a dimming function.
    The value is an integer showing the current dimming level.
    If step (from oic.r.baseresource) is present then it represents the increment between dimmer values.
    When range (from oic.r.baseresource) is omitted, then the range is [0,100].
    A value of 0 means total dimming; a value of 100 means no dimming.
