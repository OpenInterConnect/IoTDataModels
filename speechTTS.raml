  description: |
    This resource may be created on the OIC Server that is capable of rendering speech by an OIC Client
      and allows the client to provide an SSML document with text to render
      or may be created on the OIC Server by some resident application.
    The audio rendered is at this stage local to the Server (i.e. not streamed).
    The utterance is an SSML document.
    The supportedLanguages is an array of the RFC 5646 defined language tags that are supported.
    The supportedVoices is an SSML document fragment indicating the voices that are supported.
