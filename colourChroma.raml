  description: |
    This resource describes the colour using chroma conventions.
    Properties are hue, saturation, csc, and ct.
    Hue and saturation are integer values as defined by the CIECAM02 model definition (see reference [CIE CIE159:2004]).
    csc is the colour space coordinates in CIE colour space.
      The first item in the array is the X coordinate.
      The second item in the array is the Y coordinate.
    ct is the Mired colour temperature.
