    This resource describes a sensor that provides the qualitative or measured Air Quality.
    The resource is a collection of instances of oic.r.airquality detailing the individual exposed contaminant measures
    There is one collection entry per contaminant type supported by the device. A device must expose at least one measured or qualitative value.
