  description: |
    This resource specifies the pan tilt and zoom capabilities of a device.
    The resource rt is dynamic and reflects whether the values apply to
      physical movement of the device or digital/virtual enhancements to the image.
    For physical movement the rt is 'oic.r.movement.ptz'.
    For digital/virtual image enhancements the rt is 'oic.r.image.ptz'.
    The Pan and Tilt are specified in degrees.
    The Zoom Factor is a value in the range 1-100 for linear (optical) zoom.
    The Zoom Factor is a value in the range [1x, 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x, 32x] for digital zoom.
    If there is no zoom value to set the Zoom Factor shall be '1x'.
    The value 0 degrees means neutral, this is the vendor defined setting.
    Note that this resource also can be used to create an offset for physical movement.
    When that is the case, the rt value is: oic.r.movement.offset.ptz
    Note that this resource also can be used to create an offset for image movement.
    When that is the case, the rt value is: oic.r.image.offset.ptz
    When the pan_range value is omitted, then the range is [-180.0,180.0].
    If pan is not supported then the range shall be [0.0,0.0]
    When the tilt_range value is omitted, then the range is [-180.0,180.0].
    If tilt is not supported then the range shall be [0.0,0.0]
