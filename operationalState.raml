/OperationalStateResURI:
  description: |
    This resource describes the operational and job states on a device.
    The states can be read or set, setting indicates a desired state.
    A device may reject an attempt to set a state that would result
    in adverse operational characteristics.
    The machineStates is an array of the possible operational states.
    The currentMachineState is the current state of operation of the device.
    The jobStates is an array of the possible job states.
    The currentJobState is the currently active jobState.
    The runningTime is the ISO8601 encoded elapsed time in the current operational state.
    The remainingTime is the ISO8601 encoded time till completion of the current operational state.
    The progressPercentage is the percentage completeness of the current jobState.

          This response is generated by the OIC Server when the client sends:
            An update with an value for currentMachineState that is not found in machineStates.
            An update with an value for currentJobState that is not found in jobStates.
