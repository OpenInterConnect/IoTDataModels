  description: |
    This Resource provides information about the status of a heating zone of a Cook-Top.
    It describes the case of a Cook-Top whose zones can be activated dynamically (i.e. the device implements pot recognition).
    maxheatinglevel defines the max level for the heating zone
    heatinglevel is the current heating level of the zone
      For each element the value range is from 0 (indication that the zone is not heating) to maxheatinglevel,
