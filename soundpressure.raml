  description: |
    This resource defines sound pressure sensed values.
    The dba is a number containing the measured sound pressure in the nomral measured units of dBa.
    The percentage is an integer representing the measured sound pressure compared to the sensitivity [0,100].
    A volume of 0 (zero) means no sound detected.
    A volume of 100 means maximum sound detected.
