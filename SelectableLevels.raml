  description: |
    This Resource provides a set of device defined 'levels' that can be selected for an operation.
    For example where a humidifier has a discrete set that model different humidity levels that can be set.
    availablelevels is an array of the levels that can be selected, these can be a number or an integer.
    targetlevel is the level that has currently been selected and is written to in order to select a new level.
    When retrieved the targetlevel provides the actual value that has been selected.
