    This resource describes the properties which guide the reporting of a state change of a Sensor.
    The silenttime represents the period after which a state change report was sent where the Sensor state change is not reported.
    The sensitivity represents the level at which the sensor detects a state change.
    These values are completely dependend on the type of Sensor and the manufacturer capability, so no range restrictions are used.
    The range from the baseresource is only applied to the sensitivity.
