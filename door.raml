/DoorResURI:
  description: |
    This resource describes the open state of the door.
    A door is modelled by means of openState (Open/Closed), openDuration (ISO 8601 Time), and openAlarm (boolean).
    For openState, the value 'Open' indicates the door is open.
    The value 'Closed' indicates the door is closed.
    The type of openDuration is an ISO 8601 Time encoded string.
    The openAlarm value 'true' indicates that the open alarm is active.
    The openAlarm value 'false' indicates that open alarm is not active.
