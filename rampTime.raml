  description: |
    This resource that describes the Ramp Time of a dimming function.
    This specifies the actual speed of changing between 2 dimming values.
    Time is specified in milliseconds [ms].
    When range (from oic.r.baseresource) is omitted the maximum value is 100 ms.
    The RampTime of 0ms indicates the minimal delay possible by the implementation.

          This response is generated by the OIC Server when the client sends:
            An update with an out of range property value for rampTime.
          The server responds with the current resource representation.
