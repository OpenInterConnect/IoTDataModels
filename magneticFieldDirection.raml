  description: |
    This resource describes the direction of the Earth's magnetic field at the observer's current point in space.
    Typical use case includes measurement of compass readings on a personal device.
    The value is an array containing Hx, Hy, Hz (in that order) each of which are floats.
    Each of Hx, Hy and Hz are expressed in A/m (Amperes per metre)
