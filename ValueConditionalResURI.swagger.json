        "description": "This resource specifies conditions that can be applied to an observed value in any Resource.\nThese conditions are applied by the server exposing the Resource to any generated notifications because of subscriptions to the Resource.\nA unicast RETRIEVE to the Resource will receive the most recent value; which may not be the most recent notified value.\nA server exposes this Resource in association with the Resource conveying the observed value.\nThis is done by means of a new Resource instance with an RT of [\"oic.r.<thing being observed>\", \"oic.r.value.conditional\"], e.g [\"oic.r.temperature\", \"oic.r.value.conditional\"].  Please see Section 5.7.1 of the published OCF Resource Type Specification for more details.\nThe threshold is the amount by which the thing being observed must change before a notification is sent.\nThe minnotifyperiod is the minimum time in ms (milliseconds) that must elapse before a notification is sent.\nIf the maxnotifyperiod (time in ms (milliseconds)) elapses then a notification must be sent.\nThe maxnotifyperiod timer resets each time a notification is sent.\nA value of '0' for any of threshold, minnotifyperiod or maxnotifyperiod means that the capability is supported but not active.\n",
