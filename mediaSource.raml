  description: |
    This resource defines a media source that exists on a device.
    The source can be an input source or output source, this resource is agnostic of that.
    The sourceName specifies a pre-defined media input or output (e.g."HDMI", "DVI")
    The sourceNumber is a numeric identifier to specify the instance (e.g. "PC", 1)
    The sourceType is an enumeration defining whether the source is audio, video or both.
    The status is a boolean that determines if the specific source instance is selected or not.
        A status of true means that the source instance is selected.
        A status of false means that the source instance is not selected.
