  description: |
    This resource specifies the actual colour in the RGB space represented as an array of integers.
    Each colour value is described with a Red, Green, Blue component.
    These colour values are encoded as an array of integer values ([R,G,B]).
    The minimum and maximum colour value per component may be described by range (from oic.r.baseresource).
    When range (from oic.r.baseresource) is omitted, then the range is [0,255].
