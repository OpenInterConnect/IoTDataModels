    This resource describes a refrigeration function.
    The filter state is a read-only value providing the percentage life time remaining for the water filter.
    RapidFreeze is a boolean that controls the rapid freeze capability if present.
    RapidCool is a boolean that controls the rapid cool capability if present.
    Defrost is a boolean that controls the defrost cycle if present.
    At least one of the listed Properties shall be present in a Resource Instance.
