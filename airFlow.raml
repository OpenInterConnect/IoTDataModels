  description: |
    This resource describes the properties associated with air flow.
    The supporteddirections is the set of valid values for the direction property for a particular instance of this resource type.
    The direction is the directionality of the air flow if applicable, if supporteddirections is also present it must be a value from that set.
    Direction values are dependent on the capabilities of the unit.
    The speed is an integer representing the current speed level for the unit.
    The range (from oic.r.baseresource) is an array of the min,max values for the speed level. If not present the range defaults to [0,100].
    automode is the status of the automode feature; Off means automode is not enabled, On means automode is active and the speed is automatically controlled by the device.

          This response is generated by the OCF Server when the client sends:
            An update with an invalid property value for direction.
            An update with an out of range property value for speed.
          The server may respond with the current resource representation.
