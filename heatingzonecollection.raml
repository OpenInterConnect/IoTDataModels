    This Resource provides information about the status of the heating zones of a Cook-Top.
    It describes the case of a Cook-Top whose zones can be activated dynamically (i.e. the device implements pot recognition).
    The resource is a collection of instances of oic.r.heatingzone detailing the individual cooktop zones
