    This resource describes the properties associated with the current geolocation coordinate.
    Geolocation is a geolocation coordinate data.
    Latitude is a device's current Latitude coordinate (degrees).
    Longitude is a device's current Longitude coordinate (degrees).
    Alt is a device's current distance (metres) above or below 'local' sea-level.
    Accuracy is the accuracy level of the latitude and longitude coordinates (metres).
    altitudeAccuracy is the accuracy level of the altitude coordinates (metres).
    heading is a direction of travel of device (degree).
    speed is a device's current velocity (metres per second).
