    This resource describes the proporties associated with glucose meter.
    The resource is an atomic measurement of glucose (oic.r.glucose), context carbohydrates (oic.r.glucose.carb), context exercise (oic.r.glucose.exercise), Hemoglobin Bound to Glucose A1c Form (HbA1c) (oic.r.glucose.hba1c), context health (oic.r.glucose.health), context meal (oic.r.glucose.meal), context medication (oic.r.glucose.medication), context sample location (oic.r.glucose.samplelocation), context tester (oic.r.glucose.tester), observed time (oic.r.time.stamp), and user ID (oic.r.userid).
