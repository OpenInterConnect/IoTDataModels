  description: |
    This resource describes a qualitative or measured contaminant that can be used to infer Air Quality.
    Measured is the actual sensed value with units per contaminant type as described below.
    Qualitative is a representative value within the range provided where the minium value is minimum contamination and maximum value is maximum contamination for the specific contaminant.
    The valueType indicates a qualitative or measured reading within the contaminantvalue Property.
    contaminantvalue contains the actual measured or qualitative level.
    range contains the allowed range for the value that is being reported (from oic.r.baseresource).
    If valueType is 'Measured' then the units for the contaminant types are as follows:
     Methanal (also known as Formaldehyde): CH2O (ug/m^3),
     Carbon Dioxide: CO2 (ppm),
     Carbon Monoxide: CO (ppm),
     Particulate Matter (less than 1 microns in diameter): PM1 (ug/m^3),
     Particulate Matter (less than 2.5 microns in diameter): PM2.5 (ug/m^3),
     Particulate Matter (less than 10 microns in diameter): PM10 (ug/m^3),
     Volatile Organic Compounds: VOC (ug/m^3)
